# Voice Measurement App Architecture

## System Overview
The Voice Measurement App follows a microservices architecture with three main components:

### 1. Frontend Applications
- Web application (React.js)
- Mobile application (React Native)
- Shared component library
- State management using Redux

### 2. Backend Services
- Authentication Service
  - JWT-based authentication
  - OAuth2 integration
  - Rate limiting

- Measurement Service
  - Voice processing
  - Data validation
  - Unit conversion

- Sync Service
  - Real-time synchronization
  - Conflict resolution
  - Offline data management

### 3. Data Storage
- PostgreSQL for primary data
- Redis for caching
- Local storage for offline data

## Security Architecture
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input sanitization
- Regular security audits

## Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of services
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing
- Database sharding strategy
