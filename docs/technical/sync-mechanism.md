# Data Synchronization Implementation

## Sync Protocol

### Core Components
1. Change Detection
   - Timestamp-based tracking
   - Version vectors
   - Modification flags

2. Conflict Resolution
   - Last-write-wins (LWW)
   - Custom merge strategies
   - User resolution options

3. Data Transport
   - REST API for basic sync
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Batch processing for large datasets

### Offline Strategy
- Queue-based sync
- Persistent storage
- Background sync service

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry mechanism
- Checkpoint system
- Data integrity validation

## Performance Considerations
- Bandwidth optimization
- Battery usage optimization
- Storage efficiency
